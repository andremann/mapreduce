In this folder, you are provided with both
- data for algoritm validation (in folder ./testData)
- real data from the INRIA Holidays dataset (in folder ./ParametriGMM_INRIA_HOLIDAYS) consisting in a dataset of 1K points and 10K points.
The two folders also contain starting parameters for the gaussian mixture model for both scenarios.

In order to run the algorithm validation, please run ./run-gmm-testData.sh
Run ./run-gmm-InriaData.sh to use INRIA dataset, instead.

Our experiments have been run on ISTI-CNR Hadoop cluster.
Results are provided in folder ./Results10K

The .jar used has been included for your convenience.
